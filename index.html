            <h1>1) Select an accessible interface. </h1>
			    <p>The selected interface is self checkout kiosk at CVS.</p>
            
            <h1>2) Prepare some questions for users regarding their experiences with the interface. </h1>
                 <!-- Lists --><!--ordered-->
		        <ol>
			        <li>What aspect of the interface do you like?</li>
			        <li>What aspect of the interface do you dislike?</li>
			        <li>What do you think is the most important feature that should be added?</li>
			        <li>Which feature is least important to you?</li>
                    <li>Is there any feature at the checkout kiosk that confuses you? If yes, which?</li>
                    <li>What do you think of the layout of the checkout kiosk?</li>
                    <li>Why did you choose self-checkout instead of manual checkout?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything surprising or unexpected about the checkout kiosk?</li>
                    <li>If you could improve one feature about the checkout kiosk, what would it be and why?</li>
					<li>What is your favorite payment method?</li>

			<h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>
            <h1>1) Write a few sentences or bullets describing the key observations you gained from observing your users. </h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Users like language selections, coupon scanning and various payment options about the check-out kiosk. </li>
				<li>The most important feature that should be added is a Restart button. When a user scans an item but doesn't want it, or when the check-out machine is frozen, the user can restart the check-out by touching the Restart button.</li>
				<li>Customers choose self-checkout instead of manual checkout for the following reasons. They like self-service; There is a line at the manual checkout; They don’t want to talk with others.</li>
				<li>As for their favorite payment method, two prefer credit cards and the other one prefers Paypal.</li>
				<li>One feature that should be improved is the receipt option. Currently, users only have two options: no receipt and print receipt. A third option to send electronic receipts should be added.</li>
				<li>When a user used the check-out kiosk the first time, she felt confused about the coupon scanning</li>
			</ul>
            
            <h1>2) List your questions in a numbered list and summarize the responses of your interviewed users using up to 5 bullet points. </h1>
